I was working on a case and suddenly there was a power cut / connection failure. Is it possible to rework on that case?
An unfinished case review due to some unforeseen situations such as a network/electricity failures would typically be pushed to queue for routing again, and delivered to any available teammates for review within the hour. If you'd like to work on the unfinished case within an hour, you can use the self-assignment feature in the 'My Worked Cases' module.
